    <h1>Salman Rahman</h1>
    <p>M.S. in Natural Language Processing</p>

	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<p>Salman's research interests span the fields of natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social science. His work focuses on developing culturally-aware and socially responsible AI systems that can effectively counter misinformation, detect harmful online behaviors, and foster healthy online communities. Specific areas of interest include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cross-lingual and multi-lingual approaches to propaganda detection and fact-checking</li>
		<li>Integrating cultural knowledge and social context into NLP models</li>
		<li>Developing robust and equitable methods for identifying and mitigating online toxicity</li>
		<li>Leveraging computational methods to understand and address the spread of misinformation across different platforms and communities</li>
		<li>Designing NLP tools and resources for low-resource languages and dialects</li>
	</ul>
